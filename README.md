# krea-test

This repository contains the solution to a requested code test.

The test consisted in coming up with a solution to calculate the score of the last board/card to win in a bingo game.

The sequence of numbers to run the game and the boards are is given in a txt file and the score of a board is calculated by multiplying the sum of all the not marked numbers on a board by the number that was called out when that board won.

There are two txt files, one with a mockup input and another with the real input for the final answer.
